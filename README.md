# Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier - From Scratch Implementation

This repository contains a Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier implemented from scratch using Python. The classifier leverages Gaussian (Normal) distribution to handle continuous data and classifies samples based on Bayes' Theorem.

**Features 🛠️**
No external ML libraries: Fully built from scratch.
Gaussian Assumption: Handles continuous features using Gaussian distributions.
Customizable: Easily adaptable for various datasets.
Performance Evaluation: Includes accuracy and visualization tools for better insights.

**Libraries Used 📚**
NumPy: For efficient numerical computations.
Pandas: For data loading and preprocessing.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
SciPy: To compute probability density functions.

**How It Works ⚙️**
Theoretical Background
Gaussian Naive Bayes applies Bayes' Theorem
